		<p>I write WordPress themes using either Foundation or my own hand coded styles. I write high quality HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, and PHP that is clean, organized, and easily maintained. This allows the code I write to be easily read and understood by the next person who works with it.</p>
		<p>I write well organized CSS/Sass in an object-oriented structure, which allows components to be very easily reused. I’m familiar with task runners such as Gulp and Grunt, but generally prefer to use CodeKit. <em>Don't use pre-processors, task-runners, or other fancy stuff?</em> I can work with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS just fine.</p>
		<p>The websites I create are responsive, so you don’t have to worry about how your site will work on a phone or tablet. Even if your design doesn’t include a separate mockup for different screen sizes, I can help translate your beautiful design to work on any mobile device.</p>
